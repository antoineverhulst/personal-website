# Antoine Verhulst

**Data Analyst** at BlaBlaCar Daily

## About Me

I'm a data analyst at BlaBlaCar, the shared travel app and one of the most successful French startups.

I work at BlaBlaCar Daily, a new application created in 2017 to promote carpooling for commuters.

I joined the team in 2019 to supervise the data management of the app. I oversee the data warehouse and the ETLs of the application, I maintain the dashboards and daily reports to support decision-making, and I build deep analysis to understand our activity. In parallel, I've built several simple machine learning tools to improve our processes.
