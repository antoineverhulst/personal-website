I'm a data and product expert combining technical expertise with strategic vision to design data and AI products in the transportation sector. My goal is to apply this dual competency to regulation and the design of more effective and equitable public policies.

Currently leading a team of 10 data experts at BlaBlaCar, I bridge technical challenges and socio-economic objectives through my dual background in business engineering and econometrics research.
