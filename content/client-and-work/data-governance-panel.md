# Data Governance in Transport Services

## Panel on Data Sharing Regimes

Participated in a panel discussion held by the Governance and Regulation chair at Paris Dauphine University, addressing the question: **"What data sharing regime for value-added transport services?"**

### Panel Context

The panel brought together institutional actors and industry practitioners to discuss the evolving landscape of data governance in the transportation sector, particularly regarding emerging mobility services and platform-based transport.

### Key Discussion Topics

#### Data Sharing Between Public and Private Actors

- What data should mobility operators share with public authorities?
- How can data sharing benefit both public policy and business operations?
- Standards and protocols for interoperability

#### Regulatory Frameworks

- European and national approaches to mobility data regulation
- GDPR implications for mobility data
- Balancing transparency with competitive concerns

#### Value Creation from Transport Data

- How can shared data create value for all stakeholders?
- Use cases for public authorities (planning, regulation, subsidy optimization)
- Use cases for operators (network effects, service improvement)
- Benefits for users and communities

#### Privacy and Competition

- Protecting user privacy while enabling data-driven policy
- Preventing market concentration through data monopolies
- Fair competition in data-driven mobility markets

### Industry Perspective

Drawing from my experience at BlaBlaCar, I contributed practical insights on:

- Real-world challenges of data collection and sharing in carpooling platforms
- How data has been used to measure the effectiveness of public subsidy programs
- Technical and operational considerations for data sharing infrastructure
- The role of data in building trust between platform operators and public authorities

### Institutional Context

The panel was part of ongoing academic and policy discussions about how to govern platform-based services in the public interest, while preserving innovation incentives and protecting fundamental rights.

### Related Work

- Contribution to Horizon 2020 'GECKO' project on new mobility governance
- Academic research on subsidizing network effects in carpooling
- Practical experience developing data infrastructure for mobility authorities

### Impact

These discussions contribute to shaping regulatory frameworks that can enable data-driven transportation policy while respecting the needs of all stakeholders including citizens, operators, and public authorities.
