# GECKO Project: New Mobility Governance

## European Research on Mobility Governance

Contribution to the Horizon 2020 'GECKO' project focusing on governance frameworks for new mobility services across Europe.

### Project Overview

GECKO is a European research project funded under Horizon 2020, examining how cities and regions can effectively govern emerging mobility services including ride-sharing, car-sharing, e-scooters, and other innovative transportation solutions.

### My Contribution

As a practitioner from BlaBlaCar, I contributed industry insights and real-world data perspectives to help bridge the gap between academic research and operational realities in the mobility sector.

### Key Focus Areas

- **Regulatory Frameworks:** Development of governance models for new mobility services
- **Data Sharing:** Protocols and standards for mobility data exchange between public and private actors
- **Policy Design:** Evidence-based recommendations for municipal and regional authorities
- **Stakeholder Collaboration:** Frameworks for public-private partnerships in mobility

### Research Themes

1. **Governance Models:** How can cities effectively regulate platform-based mobility services?
2. **Data for Decision-Making:** What data should be shared between operators and authorities?
3. **Equitable Access:** Ensuring new mobility services benefit all citizens
4. **Environmental Impact:** Measuring and optimizing the sustainability of shared mobility

### Outcomes

The project aims to provide European cities and regions with practical tools and frameworks for governing new mobility services, balancing innovation with public interest objectives including accessibility, safety, and environmental sustainability.
