I'm a data analyst at BlaBlaCar, the shared travel app and one of the most successful french startup. 

I work at BlaBlaCar Daily, a new application created in 2017 to promote carpooling for commuters. 

I've joined the team in 2019 to supervise the data management of the app. I oversee the data warehouse and the ETL's of the application, I'm maintaining the dashboards and daily reports to support the decision-making and I'm building deep analysis to understand our activity. In parralel, I've built several simple machine learning tools to improve our processes.
